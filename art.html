      <h1>Artworks from the Gondola Space Community</h1>
      <p>
         I'll be putting some artworks made by the community here soon. Our OC community has produced many beautiful gondolas, quite a few of which have travelled far and wide to many corners of the Internet.

      <h1>Artworks by Seong</h1>
      <p>
         I've been making a gondola a day since 2019-10-31. They're not very well organised for display purposes yet, and I'm planning on using them to tell stories on this website. You can look at them <a href="seongs-art.html">here</a>. Be warned that there's a lot of files on one page. I'll implement pagination or gallery view some time...
