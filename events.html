  	<p>Let's make a gondola pixel art together!</p>
  	<p>For this event, we are going to use an app called <a href="https://www.dotpict.net">DotPict</a>. DotPict is free to use and download, and is one of the best tools for making pixel art on the go.</p>
  	<p>The theme of the event will be announced at the beginning of the event, on the 14th of November! Until then, please try downloading DotPict and making some pixel artworks.</p>
  	<p>Some tips for using DotPict:</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>After creating a new artwork file, go to the settings (the spanner button) and enable the <strong>Layers</strong> option. This allows you to use up to 3 layers, which can be moved around by going into the layers window and holding down on the one you want to move.</li>
  		<li>If you change a colour in your palette, everything in the artwork that used that colour will change! You can create new colours by clicking the <strong>+</strong> button in the palette.</li>
  		<li>You will lose your undo/redo history if you exit out of the artwork.</li>
  		<li>Try making the canvas size as small as possible to start off with.</li>
  		<li>For more tips, come visit the <a href="https://www.discord.me/Gondola">Discord</a> server and ask one of the pixel artists about it!</li>
