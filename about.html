      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
         This is the About page. I'll be writing down some design ideas I have for Gondola Space here, including content ideas. <br>
         Maybe I'm supposed to put things like this on Github. I'm not sure, but I can move it if that's the case!
      </p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Improved resource page that is nicer to look at.</li>
            <li>An "Artworks" page that shows some artworks made by the community members.<br>I think it would be nice if you can both scroll through multiple of them at a time but also see some comments and links specific to the artwork, as well as be able to link directly to any specific artwork.<br>It would also be nice to add metadata to each artwork. Maybe RDFa would work best, since I don't know how to use databases yet.</li>
            <li>A <i>garden path</i> connecting different parts of the website that are nice to take a stroll through. I'd like for there to be a narrative to the experience of viewing this site.</li>
            <li>An essay on the early history of Gondola that I started a few years ago but never finished.</li>
            <li>An essay on the prehistory of Gondola (namely, the art history of Taoism and Zen) that I started a few years ago but never finished.</li>
            <li>An "About" page that explains what the site is about, as well as what Gondola is.</li>
            <li>A "Back to main page" button on each page. Maybe I can do this in CSS so that it will automatically show up on every new page I make.</li>
            <li>Some nice buttons that link to each page from the main page.</li>
         </ul>
