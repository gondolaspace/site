# Gondola Space

## About the Website

This is Gondola Space, a sanctuary that I am building for Gondola. I plan to upload some artworks, writing, and put together resources for people who love to appreciate Gondola and to make gondola artworks. I'd like to curate artworks into different spaces, like shrines along a mountain path.

## License

I've just started teaching myself HTML and this is part of my learning process. I'd like to put any website code up under the MIT license, but not the artworks. The rights to each artwork will be up to the original creator. I'll put up proper license information later after I learn more about how it works!
